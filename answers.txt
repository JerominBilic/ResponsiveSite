Can you describe why Responsive Design is important for business?
It enhances the user experience which leads to repeat traffic which increases sales if the website is designed properly. Now a days people use their phone to browse sites but they might also use their computer and we have to make sure the site works as well in both scenarios. A good responsive design like the apple site creates a vibe that invites the user back to keep browsing their site.



Which one of the mentioned examples would you like to design? Which tools would you use?
Probably the GitHub one since its the most eye catching in my opinion. And I would use the fluid grid system, its super useful and easy to implement.
